Introduction
In this project, we'll create a simple game called rock paper scissors.

Working of the Game
If you don't know, here's how the game works:

This game is played between two players.
Each player can choose either rock or paper or scissors.
If both players choose the same thing, it's a draw.
However, if the players choose different things, one will win and the other will lose. The rule is:

1. rock - scissors: rock will win (rock crushes scissors)

Rock Wins
Figure: Rock Wins
2. rock - paper: paper wins (paper covers rock)

Paper Wins
Figure: Paper Wins
3. scissors - paper: scissors wins (scissors cuts paper)

Scissors Win
Figure: Scissors Win
Project Description
Here's how our project works:

This game will be played between the computer and the user.
The computer will randomly pick either rock, paper or scissors. The user will not know what the computer picks.
The user will be asked to choose either rock, paper or scissors.
We will compare the computer's pick and the user's pick and decide whether the user won or lost or drew.
Let's get started.
